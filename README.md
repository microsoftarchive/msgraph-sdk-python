[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/msgraph.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/msgraph)

*Please note that this SDK is in preview at current time -  feel free to provide feedback/report issues as appropriate.*

## Installation

Once you've downloaded the Graph SDK for Python, open a command prompt and type the following to install it:

<pre><code>pip install msgraph</code></pre>

Next, include the SDK in your Python project by adding:

<pre><code>import msgraph</code></pre>

## Getting Started with Microsoft Graph

### Registering your application

Register your application to use the Microsoft Graph API by using one of the following
supported authentication portals:

* [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) (**Recommended**):
  Register a new application that authenticates using the v2.0 authentication endpoint. This endpoint authenticates both personal (Microsoft) and work or school (Azure Active Directory) accounts.
* [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://manage.windowsazure.com): Register
  a new application in your tenant's Active Directory to support work or school
  users for your tenant, or multiple tenants.

### Authentication

To interact with the Graph API, your app must authenticate. Choose the [scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) needed for your app.

Graph uses OAuth to Authenticate. Use the following endpoints to authenticate:
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token

You must implement an authentication provider that derives from AuthProviderBase. Once that is complete, the graph client will use the supplied provider for authenticating calls to the graph.

## Examples

**Note:** All examples assume that your app has already been
[authenticated](#authentication).

### Creating a client

```python
import msgraph

graph_base_url = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/'
http_provider = msgraph.HttpProvider()
auth_provider = <instantiate your auth provider implementation here>

client = msgraph.GraphServiceClient(graph_base_url, http_provider, auth_provider)
```

### Upload an Item

```python
returned_item = client.item(drive="me", id="root").children["newfile.txt"].upload("./path_to_file.txt")
```

### Download an Item

```python
root_folder = client.item(drive="me", id="root").children.get()
id_of_file = root_folder[0].id

client.item(drive="me", id=id_of_file).download("./path_to_download_to.txt")
```

### Add a folder

```python
f = graph.Folder()
i = graph.Item()
i.name = "New Folder"
i.folder = f

returned_item = client.item(drive="me", id="root").children.add(i)
```

### Copy an Item

```python
from msgraph.item_reference import ItemReference

ref = ItemReference()
ref.id = "yourparent!id" #path also supported

copy_operation = client.item(drive="me", id="youritemtocopy!id").copy(name="new copied name", parent_reference=ref).post()

#copy_operation.item will return None until the copy has completed.
#If you would like to block until the operation has been completed
#and copy_operation.item is no longer None
copy_operation.poll_until_complete()

```

### Rename an Item

```python
renamed_item = graph.Item()
renamed_item.name = "NewItemName"
renamed_item.id = "youritemtorename!id"

new_item = client.item(drive="me", id=renamed_item.id).update(renamed_item)
```

### Paging through a collection

```python
#get the top three elements of root, leaving the next page for more elements
collection = client.item(drive="me", id="root").children.request(top=3).get()

#get the first item in the collection
item = collection[0]

#get the next page of three elements, if none exist, returns None
collection2 = collection.next_page_request.get()
```

### Async operations

For async operations, you can create an `asyncio.coroutine` and execute it with
`loop.run_until_complete`.

```python
import asyncio

@asyncio.coroutine
def run_gets(client):
    coroutines = [client.drive("me").request().get_async() for i in range(3)]
    for future in asyncio.as_completed(coroutines):
        drive = yield from future
        print(drive.id)

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(run_gets(client))   
```
